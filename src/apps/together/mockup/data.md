# Data Models

## Client
* Unique Identifiers for each user.
* Track users current position.
* Track users realtime changes.
* Continue to use chatango for communication.
* (Google has a real time API that I could use for the live text, this will manage timestamps and users. (Much easier implementation))


## Admin
* Unique Identifiers for each administrator.
* Tracking user changes.


## Revisions
* Added boundaries so images would not go over the sides.
